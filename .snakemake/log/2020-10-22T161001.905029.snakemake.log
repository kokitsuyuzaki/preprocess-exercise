Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

rule mars:
    output: results/mars.RData

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 14 of /Users/tsuyusakikouki/Desktop/elwood/Dev/preprocess-exercise/Snakefile:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
results/mars.RData
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
