Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs

Error in rule mars_rmd:
    jobid: 8
    output: results/mars_rmd.html
    log: logs/mars_rmd.log (check log file(s) for error message)
    shell:
        src/mars_rmd.sh
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
