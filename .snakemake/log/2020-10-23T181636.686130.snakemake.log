Error in rule mars_papermill:
    jobid: 6
    output: results/papermill_5.ipynb
    log: logs/papermill_5.log (check log file(s) for error message)
    shell:
        papermill notebooks/papermill.ipynb results/papermill_5.ipynb -p ncomponents 5
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job mars_papermill since they might be corrupted:
results/papermill_5.ipynb
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
