Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	all
	1	mars_html
	1	mars_nb
	3

rule mars_html:
    input: data/count.txt.gz, data/expdesign.txt.gz
    output: results/mars.html
    log: logs/mars_html.log

Error in rule mars_html:
    jobid: 2
    output: results/mars.html
    log: logs/mars_html.log (check log file(s) for error message)
    shell:
        jupyter nbconvert --to html --execute --stdout notebooks/mars.ipynb --output results/mars.html
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
